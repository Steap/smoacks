# SMOACKS Development Environment

There are assumptions about the development environment for SMOACKS code
generation.

1. You have access to a kubernetes server for development. SMOACKS is developed
   using a local minikube instance, and production applications are deployed to
   a separate production cluster.
2. You are going to run automated tests against a separate testing instance on
   the development cluster. The purpose of this is to ensure that test data is
   kept separate from development data.
3. You have a development database server on which separate test and dev
   databases can be created
4. CI/CD testing is done on another instance. SMOACKS is tested using a
   Jenkins testing environment.

Based on these assumptions, environment variable files generated by SMOACKS
will conditionally set up a set of environment variables used by the app using
different values based on a single environment variable switch.
